# Simple Calculator

This should take some input and add it to something, or take in multiple inputs to control the calculator even more.

My solution is much more complicated than it needs to be (and much less complicated than it could be) so try not to use mine to write yours.

I have written my solution in python 3, so you will need that to run it. You can run the following commands while in this directory:

    ./solution.py
or
    python solution.py

Good Luck!
