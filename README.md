Hi Kayla! Here is a list of projects that you can try to use learn how to program. I'm going to try to order them from easiest to hardest. I recommend starting with python but you can try implementing them agian in other languages. You should try C or C++ and Ruby as well as python.

## Languages to Try

    1. Python
    2. C or C++
    3. Ruby

## Projects

    1.  Hello World (Obviously)
    2.  Simple Calculator
    3.  Dice Rolling Simulator
    4.  Guess The Number
    5.  Hangman
    6.  Simple Text Based Interface
    7.  Integral Calculator
    8.  Image Manipulator
    9.  Wikipedia Web Scraper
    10. 2048 in a terminal

All of these projects can be as simple or complex as you would like them to be. You can add UI or not. The language you choose could also make a difference in difficulty. 

If you have anything to add, let me know!
